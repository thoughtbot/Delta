/**
 This protocol is used when you want to do some async behavior that updates the
 store.  It is very minimal in that it's not allowed to modify the store
 directly. The async behavior is done within the `call` method and to make
 changes it should dispatch a synchronous action.

 Sample Action:

 ```swift
 struct FetchUsers: DynamicActionType {
     func call() {
         someApi.fetchUsers { users in
             store.dispatch(SetUsersAction(users: users))
         }
     }
 }

 store.dispatch(UpdateIdAction(id: 1))
 ```
*/
public protocol DynamicActionType {
    /**
     The return type from the `call` method.

     - note: This is inferred from the `call` method implementation.
    */
    typealias ResponseType

    /**
     This method is where you perform some async behavior that when completed,
     should dispatch a synchronous action on the store.

     You can optionally return an object that wraps async behavior. This might
     be a `Promise` from PromiseKit or `SignalProducer` from ReactiveCocoa.
    */
    func call() -> ResponseType
}
